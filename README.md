# Casino

## Description: 
This project simulates a casino experience by integrating a slot machine and a roulette wheel. Users can enjoy a complete gambling environment, including money management, betting, and automatic payouts.

## How It Works:

The user starts by entering their name and the initial amount of money they have.

They then decide how much of their money to convert into chips for gameplay.

Users can choose between two games: the slot machine or the roulette wheel.

  For the slot machine, $20 is deducted per game, and prizes are awarded based on the numbers that appear.
  
  For the roulette wheel, users place bets on a number and color and win or lose based on the outcome of the spin.
